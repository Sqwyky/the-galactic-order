# The Galactic Order

A web-based multiplayer space exploration game built on **Cellular Automata** and **fractal mathematics**, inspired by No Man's Sky. Every planet, creature, and mountain grows from Wolfram's 256 elementary rules.

**[Play Live Demo](https://sqwyky.github.io/the-galactic-order/client/landing.html?rule=30&seed=42)**

> *"Does the universe have source code?"* — This game answers: **Yes. Rule 30.**

---

## What Makes This Different

- **256 universes from math alone** — each Wolfram CA rule (0-255) generates an entirely unique planet with distinct terrain, flora, rocks, atmosphere, and sky
- **Superformula-driven models** — alien flora and rocks are generated by the Gielis superformula, driven by CA rule parameters. No 3D modeling software needed.
- **Harmonic Resonance system** — every planet has a frequency derived from its CA rule, mapped to brainwave bands (Delta/Theta/Alpha/Beta/Gamma) that drive atmosphere, mood, fog, wind, bloom, and NPC behavior
- **Deterministic seeds** — same coordinates = same world. Share planet locations with friends. Infinite universe, zero storage.
- **Ship flight** — walk on surfaces, board your ship with E, fly anywhere, shoot lasers/rockets, scan planets, hyperspace jump to new worlds

## Current Status

### Working (Playable)
- Atmospheric descent animation (orbit → surface)
- Infinite terrain generation via WebWorker (60 FPS)
- First-person walking with gravity, sprint, jump, head bob
- NMS-style procedural sky dome with FBM clouds
- Animated water shader (waves, Fresnel, specular, shore foam)
- Supershape alien flora (5 unique variants per planet, wind sway)
- Supershape rocks from CA rule
- Instanced grass system
- Atmospheric dust particles
- Post-processing pipeline (SSAO, bloom, color grading, film grain)
- The Mysterious Being NPC encounter + dialogue
- In-game tablet (TAB) with planet data
- Procedural planet naming
- Ship flight (WASD + mouse steering, boost, free-look)
- Weapons (laser + rockets with visual effects)
- Environment scanner (C key)
- Hyperspace jump to random planets (Space key)
- Harmonic Resonance / Planet Mood system from Antigravity Brain integration

### In Progress
- Gemini AI integration for NPC intelligence
- Galaxy map / star system navigation
- Multiplayer via WebSocket
- Terminal cipher-breaking system

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Three.js (WebGL), vanilla JS modules, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js static server
- **Generation**: Wolfram CA engine, Gielis superformula, FNV-1a hashing
- **Rendering**: Custom GLSL shaders, EffectComposer post-processing
- **AI** (planned): Google Gemini API (player-provided keys)
- **Testing**: Vitest

```

### Core Pipeline

```
Planet Seed → hashSeed (FNV-1a)
  → CA Rule (0-255)
    → Wolfram Class (1-4)
      → Terrain heightmap (via WebWorker)
      → Superformula shapes (flora + rocks)
      → Harmonic frequency → Brainwave band → Sky/Fog/Wind/Bloom/NPC mood
      → Biome colors → Vertex coloring
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Sqwyky/the-galactic-order.git
cd the-galactic-order

# Install deps (just vitest for testing)
npm install

# Run
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3000/landing.html?rule=30&seed=42
```

### Try Different Rules

- `?rule=30` — Chaotic (lush, wild terrain)
- `?rule=90` — Fractal (crystalline, geometric)
- `?rule=110` — Complex (edge of chaos, intricate)
- `?rule=0` — Dead (barren, minimal)
- `?rule=150` — Dense (organic, overgrown)

## Origin Story

Born from a conversation about whether the universe has "source code." Explored cellular automata, information physics (Bekenstein Bound, holographic principle), and fractal patterns. The game uses these concepts as both the **generation engine** AND the **in-game lore** — players discover that their universe literally runs on CA rules.

Built collaboratively with Claude (AI Builder) and Gemini (AI Architect, in-game NPC).
